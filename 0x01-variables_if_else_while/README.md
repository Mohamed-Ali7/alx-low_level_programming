**File `0-positive_or_negative.c`:** This program will assign a random number to the variable  `n`  each time it is executed and print whether the number stored in the variable  `n`  is positive or negative.

-   The variable  `n`  will store a different value every time you will run this program
-   The output of the program should be:
    -   The number, followed by
        -   if the number is greater than 0:  `is positive`
        -   if the number is 0:  `is zero`
        -   if the number is less than 0:  `is negative`
    -   followed by a new line
**File `1-last_digit.c`:** This program will assign a random number to the variable  `n`  each time it is executed and print whether the number stored in the variable  `n`  is positive or negative.

-   The variable  `n`  will store a different value every time you will run this program
The output of the program should be:

-   The string  `Last digit of`, followed by
-   `n`, followed by
-   the string  `is`, followed by
    -   if the last digit of  `n`  is greater than 5: the string  `and is greater than 5`
    -   if the last digit of  `n`  is 0: the string  `and is 0`
    -   if the last digit of  `n`  is less than 6 and not 0: the string  `and is less than 6 and not 0`

**File `1b0913997e85e349fee8`:** C program prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.

-   You can only use the  `putchar`  function (every other function (`printf`,  `puts`, etc…) is forbidden)
-   All your code should be in the  `main`  function
-   You can only use  `putchar`  twice in your code
